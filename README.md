# NEURAL-NETWORK-SIMPLE-MATRIX-VERSION
A scratch written matrix based implementation of a basic artificial neural network. (This does the same thing as prior ones, but multiplications/additions/subtractions on Neuron/Synapse components are described instead in terms of matrices.)

This is a part of my [artificial neural network practice sequence](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE).

# The project may require more than 1 run before correct results occur. Some random variable somewhere is misbehaving.


# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
  The problem space is X-OR inputs. So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in X-OR space, the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,0) output should be 0
